## Godot Ragdollie 2D

This is just a silly project, experimenting with 2D ragdolls in Godot. It features a complete setup for a 2D ragdoll with physical bones, ragdolls used for drag'n'drop previews with `Control` nodes, and an editor plugin that can add ragdolls via drag'n'drop to the current scene.

Maybe you can find this useful!
